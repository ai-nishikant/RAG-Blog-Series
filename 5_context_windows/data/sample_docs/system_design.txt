The design section describes a modular architecture with independent retrieval and generation layers.
Each component can scale horizontally for higher throughput.
APIs follow REST conventions with JSON-based data exchange.
Caching and rate limiting are implemented to stabilize latency.
The design allows new retrievers or LLMs to be integrated without major refactoring.

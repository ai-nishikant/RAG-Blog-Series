The evaluation compares multiple approaches, datasets, and metrics to benchmark model performance.
Baselines include both supervised and unsupervised methods.
Metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1 score are reported for each dataset.
The study concludes that domain-specific fine-tuning yields consistent improvements.
Results are summarized in Table 2, followed by an ablation analysis.
